# Local ACF JSON directory #

As you create Advanced Custom Fields fields and field groups, ACF will add/modify files here. Commit these changes like any other code changes in order to keep a history of your ACF revisions/additions/etc. Keeping your ACF fields under version control also makes deploying ACF-based changes to a production site about 9,000 times simpler.
